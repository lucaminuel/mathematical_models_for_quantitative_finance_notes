\chapter{Notes for readers}
\label{notes_for_reader}
These notes are derived from the "Mathematical Models for Quantitative Finance: Market Microstructure, Networks, and Systemic Risk" course of the year 2022 by Professors Fabrizio Lillo and Piero Mazzarisi. There are likely to be errors, so I recommend using these notes only as a starting point and delving deeper through books and articles. If you notice any errors, please report them to my email, or create a branch in the course repository:\href{https://github.com/lucaminuel/mathematical_models_for_quantitative_finance_notes}{GitHub} .
I would like to thank Professors Lillo and Mazzarisi for conducting this interesting course. Enjoy reading and studying!
